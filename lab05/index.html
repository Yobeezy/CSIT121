                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I have learned how to structure text through
                        a hierarchy like headers (six levels), paragraphs, and lists
                        like I am doing right now in VS code.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        Another thing I learned is 
                        hyperlinking that allows the user to hop from one page to another 
                        or you can add in an email hyperlink which is really useful, I feel.
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        Furthermore, I learned how to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> 
                        text.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p id="bruh">
                    Learning about structuring text, hyberlinking sites and emails, and customizing text
                    was realy helpful for building the foundation of how to use and view HTML in an organized, 
                    efficient manner. I learned a lot from:

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I have learned what CSS means. It means Cascading Style Sheets. CSS 
                        adds style to the webste, making it easier or harder to view depending 
                        on the purpose of the website.
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        Another thing I learned is 
                        that there are multiple ways to customize color of a background or text. 
                        You can use RGB, hexcode, just put in the actual name of the color.
                        There's also another a fourth way called RGBa which can adjust the opacity.
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        Furthermore, I learned how CSS can be incorporated into an HTML document in three ways.
                        Those ways consist of inline, internal, and external. For this lab, I am required to embed CSS externally 
                        in a different file but in the same folder.

                        Learning about what CSS is, customizing color 4 different ways, and incorporating CSS three different ways 
                        was realy helpful for building on from the basics of HTML. I learned a lot from:

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I have learned what the different CSS layouts are. It includes Normal Flow, 
                        Flexbox, and Grid. The normal flow has no CSS to it and just follows the 
                        order of the code from top to bottom. The Flexbox layout makes it easier to 
                        implement more resonsive dynamic layouts. The Grid layout allows you to 
                        create a 2D layout consisting of rows and columns. 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        Another thing I learned is 
                        that Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow you to apply different 
                        styles based on certain conditions, typically related to the characteristics of the 
                        device (phone, tablet, desktop) or browser viewing the web page. 
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        Furthermore, I learned more about configuring margin, padding, and borders in an in-depth way. 
                    </li>
