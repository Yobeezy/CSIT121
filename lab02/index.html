            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I have learned how to structure text through
                    a hierarchy like headers (six levels), paragraphs, and lists
                    like I am doing right now in VS code.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Another thing I learned is 
                    hyperlinking that allows the user to hop from one page to another 
                    or you can add in an email hyperlink which is really useful, I feel.
                </li>  
                <li>
                    Furthermore, I learned how to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> 
                    text.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Learning about structuring text, hyberlinking sites and emails, and customizing text
                was realy helpful for building the foundation of how to use and view HTML in an organized, 
                efficient manner. I learned a lot from:
            </p>

                </li>
