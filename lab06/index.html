            <h2>Fact Based Questions</h2>
            <h3 id="q1">What is the URL of the website?</h3>
            <p>The URL of the website is <a href="//www.britannica.com/sports/volleyball">//www.britannica.com/sports/volleyball</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="q2">What is the name of the website?</h3>
            <p>The name of the website is Britannica</p>
            <h3 id="q3">Who is the site's target audience?</h3>
            <p>The site’s target audience is for people who are interested in volleyball and want to know the origins, the rules, etc. of volleyball</p>
            <h3 id="q4">How is the site organized?</h3>
            <p>The site is organized through hierarchical organization. It has a clearly defined home page and navigation links to major site sections</p>
            <h3 id="q5">Which CRAP Design Principle does the website use? Provide at least one example.</h3>
            <p>The website uses all four of the CRAP Desing Principles. The one that stuck out most is the repetition aspect of the website. The website repeats/follows the same format throughout the whole webpage by bolding the headers, grouping the text together, and using images. It also repeats the same color theme with accent colors. </p>
            <h3 id="q6">What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</h3>
            <p>The Audit Score according to the Accessibility checker is 58.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="obq">
            <h2>Opinion Based Questions</h2>
            <h3 id="q7">What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h3>
            <p>The site's effectiveness is pretty good. It does support users in completing actions accurately for the most part, but if you are looking for a specific thing that is not that popular, then you may have to use the search bar but that's basically all of what's wrong sbout the site's effectiveness.</p>
            <h3 id="q8">What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?</h3>
            <p>I'd say the site's effeciency is pretty good. The user would probably only need to search up what they are looking for in the search bar, press enter, then click on the topic that they are looking for. The site generally follows the "Three Click Rule" making the user have a smooth, convenient process into what task they are completing.</p>
            <h3 id="q9">How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h3>
            <p>The engagement is okay. I would try to cut the content into bullet points instead of having blocks of text. Other than that, it is a pleasant experience.</p>
            <h3 id="q10">Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h3>
            <p>As I have stated before, instead of have big blocks of text, I would try to divide the sentences up into bullet points and have the overall content be more concise.</p>
