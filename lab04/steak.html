            <h3>Why I Chose the Image</h3>
            <p>
                I chose this image because I love steak 
                and at the time of choosing this image, I was very hungry was salivating for 
                a nice, juicy ribeye steak that I had sitting out to come to room temp is can get 
                even cooking when I cookm the steak hot and fast on my stainless steel pan. Pro tip: If you 
                are cooking hot and fast, then you shouls the steak out 10 degrees farenheit before your 
                desired doneness. For example, if you want medium rare(135 farenheit), then pull 
                the steak off at 125 degrees farenheit. With this thing called carry-over cooking due to 
                high temperature cooking, the steak will rise 5 to 10 degrees after you pull it off the pan.
