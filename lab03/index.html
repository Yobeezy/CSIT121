            <h3 id="headd">What I learned</h3>
            <ol class="uno">
                <li>
                    I have learned how to structure text through
                    a hierarchy like headers (six levels), paragraphs, and lists
                    like I am doing right now in VS code.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Another thing I learned is 
                    hyperlinking that allows the user to hop from one page to another 
                    or you can add in an email hyperlink which is really useful, I feel.
                </li>  
                <li>
                    Furthermore, I learned how to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> 
                    text.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p id="bruh">
                Learning about structuring text, hyberlinking sites and emails, and customizing text
                was realy helpful for building the foundation of how to use and view HTML in an organized, 
                efficient manner. I learned a lot from:
            </p>

            <ol class="uno">
                <li>
                    I have learned what CSS means. It means Cascading Style Sheets. CSS 
                    adds style to the webste, making it easier or harder to view depending 
                    on the purpose of the website.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Another thing I learned is 
                    that there are multiple ways to customize color of a background or text. 
                    You can use RGB, hexcode, just put in the actual name of the color.
                    There's also another a fourth way called RGBa which can adjust the opacity.
                </li>  
                <li>
                    Furthermore, I learned how CSS can be incorporated into an HTML document in three ways.
                    Those ways consist of inline, internal, and external. For this lab, I am required to embed CSS externally 
                    in a different file but in the same folder.
                </li>
            </ol>
                <p id="bruh2">
                    Learning about what CSS is, customizing color 4 different ways, and incorporating CSS three different ways 
                    was realy helpful for building on from the basics of HTML. I learned a lot from:
